This is a heavily modified version of [Cigar2](https://github.com/Cigar2/Cigar2). Originally this project started back in 2020 during quaranetine until I decided to leave on the shelf. I finally got back to it and made a new version of Cigar2 because it hasn't had a update since December of 2021.

## Installation

2. Download this repo
3. Unzip jptr-agario code into some folder.
4. Run `npm i` to get all the required modules to run it.
5. Run `npm start` to start it / you can also run `npm run dev` for dev mode.
6. Go to `localhost:1337`, and you're in!

## How to add skins
It's pretty easy, go over to the `ðŸ“‚ src` folder and find `skinList.json`
From there you can add your skins there, heres a template if you need it:
```json

{
    "skins": [
        {
            "src": "image url",
            "label": "skin name"
        }, //comma is there if you wanna add multiple, but if its just one or the last one you drop the comma.
    ]
}

```

## How to add servers
Again, pretty easy to do. Go over to the `ðŸ“‚ src` folder and find `index.html`
From there, find ```<select id="gamemode" class="form-control" onchange="setserver(this.value)" required></select>``` and add the following:
```
<option value="server url.com">name of server</option>
```
